`ipyvizzu-story` is available in the following App platforms. `ipyvizzu-story`
tries to figure out the environment it is used in and import the correct type of
`Story`, however `Story` could also be imported using full path.

We would love to add more environments and examples, so if you miss anything
from our list, please open an issue in our
[Github repo](https://github.com/vizzuhq/ipyvizzu-story).
