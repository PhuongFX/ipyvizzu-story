# Tutorial

Since `ipyvizzu-story` is built on top of
[ipyvizzu](https://github.com/vizzuhq/ipyvizzu), it's recommended that you first
understand that library before starting with this one. The tutorial for
`ipyvizzu` can be found [here](https://ipyvizzu.vizzuhq.com/latest/tutorial/).

## Basic logic of ipyvizzu

## Installation

```sh
pip install ipyvizzu-story
```

Visit [Installation chapter](../installation.md) for more options and details.

## Usage

!!! note
    `ipyvizzu-story` is to generate the `JavaScript` code, then the
    `vizzu-story` and `vizzu` calls are evaluated by the browser. Therefore if a
    blank space appears where the chart should be, check the console log of your
    browser where `vizzu-story` and `vizzu` reports its errors. If you get a
    `vizzu-story` or `vizzu` releated error in your browser console, please
    clean your browser cache, because an older version of these could be stored
    in your browser.
