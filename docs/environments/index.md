# Environments

`ipyvizzu-story` can be used in a lot of different environments. We grouped
these into several categories. `ipyvizzu-story` tries to figure out the
environment it is used in and import the correct type of Story, however Story
could also be imported using full path.

We would love to add more environments and examples, so if you miss anything
from our list, please open an issue in our
[Github repo](https://github.com/vizzuhq/ipyvizzu-story).
